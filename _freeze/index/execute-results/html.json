Then, $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution\n\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^{x}}{x !}\n$$ {#eq-poisson}\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the rate of eruptions per year. Using @eq-poisson, the probability of an eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated.\n\n| Name                 | Year   |\n| -------------------- | ------ |\n| Current              | 2021   |\n| Teneguía             | 1971   |\n| Nambroque            | 1949   |\n| El Charco            | 1712   |\n| Volcán San Antonio   | 1677   |\n| Volcán San Martin    | 1646   |\n| Tajuya near El Paso  | 1585   |\n| Montaña Quemada      | 1492   |\n\n: Recent historic eruptions on La Palma {#tbl-history}\n\n@tbl-history summarises the eruptions recorded since the colonization of the islands by Europeans in the late 1400s.\n\n![Map of La Palma](images/la-palma-map.png){#fig-map}\n\nLa Palma is one of the west most islands in the Volcanic Archipelago of the Canary Islands (@fig-map). \n\n\n{{< embed notebooks/explore-earthquakes.qmd#fig-spatial-plot >}}\n\n\n\n@fig-spatial-plot shows the location of recent Earthquakes on La Palma.\n\n## Data & Methods {#sec-data-methods}\n\n## Conclusion\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n:::{#refs}\n\n:::",
